//Using variables
// Identifying what a variable is and why we need it
// Distinguish between variable declaration & variable assignment
// Describe how to get a variable value & how to reassign it


// Assigning the value to a variable & output it
//Console in browser - F12 to program in browser

// To declare a variable we use var (var allows you to save a variable so that you can re-use it in future)
var person; //variable declaration but has not been assigned any value

//Assigning value to variable
var person = "Prabodh"

//Outputting value in browser/ console
console.log("hello", person)

var greeting = "hello"
console.log(greeting, person)

//changing the variable values - You don't need to use keyword var now for the defined variables
person = "Ram"
greeting = "hi"

console.log(greeting, person)
console.log(greeting, person)
